# Nashville_Housing_CleanUp

This repository holds a real estate dataset from Nashville, Tennessee containing property details from such as unique IDs, parcel information, land use, sale history, ownership details, and property values. I worked on cleaning and formatting the data using SQL by standardizing date formats, filling in null values correctly, removing duplicates, and dropping unnecessary columns. Additionally, I created new columns by splitting and combining existing data to enhance usability. This project allowed me to apply and refine my SQL skills in data cleaning and formatting, reinforcing my ability to work with real-world datasets. It also provided hands-on experience in structuring data for better analysis, ensuring accuracy, and improving overall data quality.
